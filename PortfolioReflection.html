</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#daf4f5;">
  <h3>1st Challange</h3>
  <p>Missed out first 2 weeks of seminar</p>
  <p>Reason: Late enrolment for this unit</p>
  <p>I was behind by 2 weeks of labs to complete, and had to complete 2 labs for the assignment
     (Initial HTML with 2 different CSS files) which I could not find on BlackBoard.</p>
</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#c4dce0;">
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hunt for Mr Michael's GitHub repository</li>
    <li>Refer to Mr Michael's GitHub repository</li>
    <li>Ends up finding another student's GitHub repository</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Most importantly, I had view the recorded iLecture with full attentiveness (for 10 minutes) 
    before hopping on the website deployed to refer to the CSS style sheet @ Inspect>Elements.</p>
</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#abcecf;">
  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>As a result, I was able to catch up to the class and complete the 2 HTML projects with different CSS files. Although it was not easy for me to rush through all the modules,
     I was pleased that I had some knowledge of HTML, CSS and javaScript which was a life saver for my case. As it helped me understand and learn new concepts quickly.</p>
  <p>I still only have like 2 friends in the class though</p>
</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#daf4f5;">
  <h3>2nd Challange</h3>
  <p>Lack of webpage ideas and inspirations.</p>
  <p>Did not have works of other student to refer to.</p>
  <p>Secretly, this procrastinator wanted to wait nearer the deadline to complete this assignment
  with full adrenaline and motivation. Which had a bad turn of events because my laptop crashed 2 day before the due date
  and my assignment was only saved locally on desktop.</p>
</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#c4dce0;">
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p>Decluttering my life and clearing my mind</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Went on a few date nights on weekdays</li>
    <li>have fun at A.S.I.A. clubbing event</li>
    <li>Celebrated my birthday with friends</li></ul>
    <p>All in all, I still gave my best attempt in this assignment at the cost of both my brain cells left. And also at the cost of my laptop shutting down on me.</p>
</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#abcecf;">
  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>A busy weekend schedule rushing to complete, finalise and piece together my whole assignment, downing Red Bulls and Costco rotisserie chicken.
     Also spending the whole day in the library to rush finish my whole assignment after transferring my data to another computer.
  </p>
  <p>Classic life of a university student, fun.</p>
</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#daf4f5;">
  <h3>3rd Challange</h3>
  <p>Unclear assignment tasks and requirements. Maybe this was a me problem because I would always like to know if the bare minimum submitted would equate to a passing mark.
     I jsut also wanted to make sure I was on the right path with my assignment progress and if I could make several changes that I wanted to make. Another me problem, I do not
    like asking questions in class, I prefer to ask in private as I can ask as many question as I like.</p>
</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#c4dce0;">
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p>Book appointments for consultation with Mr Michael on Microsoft Bookings for the following date and times:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tuesday 18th April 2023, 1.30pm</li>
    <li>Thursday 20th April 2023, 3.15pm</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="column" style="background-color:#abcecf;">
  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>Mr Micheal was so helpful as he answered all of my questions and helped me gain a better understanding of the assignment in whole. 
    Mr Michael explained the scope of the assignment and the important parts to include in my project, as well as the correct files to submit. </p>
  <p>Thank you Mr Michael</p>
